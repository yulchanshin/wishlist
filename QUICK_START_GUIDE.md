# 🚀 Quick Start: Sharing Your Wishlist

## For Wishlist Owners

### How to Share Your Wishlist

1. **Sign in** to your account
2. **Add items** to your wishlist (at least one item recommended)
3. Look for the **"Copy share link"** button on your homepage
4. Click the button to copy your unique share URL
5. **Share the link** with anyone via:
   - Text message
   - Email
   - Social media
   - Messaging apps
   - Any other method!

### Your Share Link

Your share link looks like this:
```
https://your-app.com/share/abc123xyz789
                           ↑
                    Unique identifier
```

The last part (`abc123xyz789`) is a unique 12-character code that identifies your wishlist.

### Regenerating Your Link

If you want to invalidate your old link and get a new one:

1. Click the **"Regenerate link"** button (if visible)
2. Or click the existing share link text to regenerate
3. Your old link will stop working
4. A new link will be generated
5. Copy and share the new link

**Why regenerate?**
- You shared it with someone you no longer want to have access
- You want a fresh start
- For privacy or security reasons

## Troubleshooting

### "Link not available" Error

**Problem:** The link shows an error when clicked

**Possible Causes:**
- The wishlist owner regenerated their link
- The wishlist was deleted
- The link was typed incorrectly

**Solution:** Contact the person who shared it and ask for the current link

### Copy Button Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Clicking "Copy share link" doesn't copy anything

**Possible Causes:**
- Browser doesn't support clipboard API
- Page is not on HTTPS (security requirement)
- Browser permissions denied

**Solution:** 
- Manually select and copy the link text displayed on the page
- Try a different browser
- Check browser permissions

### Can't See Images

**Problem:** Items show but images don't load

**Possible Causes:**
- Image URLs are broken
- Images hosted on sites that block embedding
- Network issues

**Solution:** 
- This is not a link issue - the link is working
- Images are hosted externally, not on this app
- Click the product link to see the item on its original website

### Share Link Not Appearing

**Problem:** Don't see a "Copy share link" button

**Possible Causes:**
- Not signed in
- Wishlist not yet created
- Page still loading

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're signed in
- Add at least one item to your wishlist
- Refresh the page
- The link is auto-generated when you sign in

## FAQ

### Do I need an account to view a shared wishlist?

**No!** Anyone with the link can view it without creating an account or signing in.

### How many people can view my shared wishlist?

**Unlimited!** Share with as many people as you want. The link works for everyone.

### Can I have multiple share links for the same wishlist?

**No.** Each wishlist has one unique share link. You can regenerate it to get a new link, but that invalidates the old one.

### Does the link expire?

**No.** The link is permanent until you regenerate it or delete your wishlist.

### Can people see when I add/remove items?

**Yes.** If they refresh the page, they'll see the current state of your wishlist.

### Can I see who viewed my wishlist?

**No.** The app doesn't currently track views or analytics. (This could be a future feature!)

### Can I password-protect my shared wishlist?

**Not currently.** The link itself acts as the "password" - only people with the link can access it. Use the regenerate feature to revoke access.

### What happens if I delete my account?

Your wishlist and all items are automatically deleted, and the share link stops working.
